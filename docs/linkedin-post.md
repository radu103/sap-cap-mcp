# ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project: SAP CAP MCP Server

I'm thrilled to announce the release of my new open-source project: SAP CAP MCP Server!

This tool revolutionizes SAP Cloud Application Programming (CAP) development by providing specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that seamlessly integrate with VS Code, making CDS development faster and more intuitive with Co-Pilot and ChatGpt or Claude Sonnet AI models

## What makes this project special:

âœ… **Streamlined Development**: Generate CDS schemas and entities with simple conversational prompts
âœ… **Tight Integration**: Works directly within VS Code through the Model Context Protocol
âœ… **Developer Friendly**: Eliminates boilerplate code and enforces best practices automatically
âœ… **Self-Contained**: Runs as a standalone executable with minimal setup

## Key features include:
- One-click creation of fully featured SAP CAP entities and services
- Schema generation with proper namespace structure
- Support for managed entities with automatic timestamps
- Intuitive conversational interface for complex operations

If you're working with SAP CAP or interested in modern development tooling, I'd love your feedback! Check out the GitHub repository: [link]('https://github.com/radu103/sap-cap-mcp')
